# TMPRS

TMPRS is a **T**erminal-based **M**usic **P**layer made using **R**u**s**t

See what I did there?

I'd like to stress that while TMPRS is functional, it may have bugs and it is not very aestheticly pleasing.
If you encounter any errors, please create an issue (and do the same if you have any feature requests!).

## Installation

TMPRS 0.0.1 has now been packaged for RPM! You can install the RPM from the [releases](https://github.com/AuraPy/tmprs/releases).
